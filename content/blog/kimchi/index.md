#### Step 1

Cut cabbage in half through the core, then cut a slit through the core 2 inches above the stem so that the leaves are loosened but still attached. Dunk the halves in a large bowl of water to moisten all the leaves. Place on a work surface. Sprinkle the salt between the leaves and put the cabbage in a large bowl. Let stand for 1½ hours, turning the cabbage over every 30 minutes.

#### Step 2

Meanwhile, combine the rice flour and water in a saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until it bubbles, about 10 minutes. Add the sugar and cook, stirring, until the porridge is a little translucent and thinner, a few more minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.

#### Step 3

Rinse the cabbage halves under cold running water, ruffling the leaves to remove any dirt and the excess salt. Split each half lengthwise into 2 pieces. Drain well.

#### Step 4

Prepare the kimchi paste: Put the cooled porridge, garlic, ginger, shiso, fish sauce, hot pepper flakes, radish, scallions, and chives in a large bowl. Mix well. 

#### Step 5

Leaving the cabbage quarters intact, spread some kimchi paste over each leaf. Pack the cabbage quarters into the four Mason jars or other airtight containers and cover. Leave a little bit of "head room" to allow for fermentation.

#### Step 6

Let stand at cool room temperature. Once the kimchi has condensed sufficiently (~1 day), combine kimchi into 2 jars. Burp kimchi every 12ish hours and taste until the kimchi smells and tastes sour, 1 to 2 days (depending on ambient temperature). Move to refrigerator. 

#### Serve

Serve by cutting kimchi with kitchen scissors and removing cut pieces from jar.
